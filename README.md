# GitHub Actions ChatGPT PR Reviewer

This GitHub actions uses OpenAI ChatGPT in order to review the changes
presented in a PR and will recommend improvements.

### How to use

Include the following into your github actions step

```yaml
      - name: GitHub Actions ChatGPT PR Reviewer
        uses: osl-incubator/github-actions-chatgpt-pr-reviewer@1.0.3
        with:
          openai_api_key: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}  # required
          openai_model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo'  # optional
          openai_temperature: 0.5  # optional
          openai_max_tokens: 2048  # optional
          openai_extra_criteria: |  # optional, use `;` for separate the criteria items
            - prefer readable variable name instead of short names like `k` and `v`;
            - use `SOLID` principles design pattern as reference in your review;
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}  # required
          github_pr_id: ${{ github.event.number }}  # required
```

The initial criteria use for the ChatGPT would look like this:

```
  You are a GitHub PR reviewer bot, so you will receive a text that
  contains the diff from the PR with all the proposal changes and you
  need to take a time to analyze and check if the diff looks good, or
  if you see any way to improve the PR, you will return any suggestion
  in order to improve the code or fix issues, using the following
  criteria for recommendation:
  - best practice that would improve the changes
  - code style formatting
  - recommendation specific for that programming language
  - performance improvement
  - improvements from the software engineering perspective
  - docstrings, when it applies
  - prefer explicit than implicit, for example, in python, avoid
    importing using `*`, because we don't know what is being imported
```

Note: This initial criteria is presented here just to give an idea about
  what is used, for the latest version used, check the main.py file.
